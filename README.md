Jupyter Notebook Learning Samples Project. ðŸ”Š 


## The prerequisites of the project running:

1. Python venv environment (version 3.6 or above).

2. Jupyter Notebook. 

3.  Conda & BeakerX. (the environment for BeakerX app test)


---


## Installation Guide For Venv Mode:

1. Create the **working directory**. (named it as you wish)

2. Run the following command line in **working directory** to create a new Python 'venv' environment. 

    ```
    $ python3 -m venv venv
    ```

## App Running Steps: (Venv  Mode)

1. Jump into the **working directory**.

2. Run the following command lines.

    ```bash
    $ . venv/bin/activate
    (venv) $ jupyter notebook
    ```

    or using below shell script.

    ```bash
    $ ./nbstart
    ```
    *(note: run the command line **`chmod a+x ./nbstart`** before running above shell script)*

3. Packages list (venv mode): See [pip_list.txt](pip_list.txt)

## Notice For BeakerX App Launching.

1. BeakerX is basing on conda environment . Check out [Conda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and [BeakerX ](http://beakerx.com/documentation) for more details about their installations.

    ```bash
    (base) $ beakerx
    ```

2. All BeakerX samples saved in the folder `./beakerx_samples/`.

3. Packages list (conda mode): See [pip_list_beakerx.txt](pip_list_beakerx.txt)

PS: It seems there's certain conflict existed in my jupyter/nbextensions configuration between my venv mode and conda mode, it's not a big problem though, ok to work.
